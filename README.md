```

## Step 2: Set Up and Run the Backend

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Step 3: Start the Backend Server
5. Navigate to the backend folder from the root Sentiment-Analyzer-for-Public-Services-in-Islamabad folder 
```bash
cd backend
```
6. Then from the backend folder run this command

```bash
python main.py
```

## Step 4: Get Your Local IP Address
Run the following command in your terminal to get your local IPv4 address:

- On Windows:

4. Replace the base URL with your own IP address (keep the port `8000` as is).  
   Example:
   ```dart
   const String baseUrl = "http://x.x.x.x:8000";
   ```

## üö® Notes:
- **Google Maps** will only work if:
  - You use your **own Google Maps API key**.
  - You run the app **on a mobile device**, not a laptop/emulator.

### To update the API key:
1. Go to:
   ```
   frontend/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
   ```
2. Replace the placeholder API key with your own:
   ```xml
   <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
              android:value="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"/>
   ```
